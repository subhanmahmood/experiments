## Lunch Options (Office Days)

Your current options ranked and optimized:

### Salad Bar (BEST OPTION)
Build your own for ~450-550 cal, 40-50g protein:

| Base | Protein | Toppings | Avoid |
|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Mixed leaves | Chicken breast (double portion) | Cucumber, tomato, peppers | Creamy dressings |
| Spinach | Tuna | Sweetcorn, beetroot | Croutons |
| | Eggs | Feta (small amount) | Pasta salad additions |

**Order:** "Double chicken, mixed leaves, cucumber, tomato, peppers, olive oil dressing"

Approximate: 450 cal, 45g protein, 18g fat, 15g carbs

### Waitrose Meal Deal (OPTIMIZED)

**Best sandwich choices:**
| Sandwich | Calories | Protein | Notes |
|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| Chicken & bacon | ~450 | ~28g | Solid choice |
| Chicken salad | ~380 | ~25g | Lower cal |
| Tuna mayo | ~420 | ~22g | Decent |
| Prawn | ~350 | ~18g | Lower protein |

**Skip:** BLT, cheese-heavy options, triple-decker sandwiches

**Side swap:**
- Crisps → Protein bar (if available) or nuts
- Or: Accept the crisps, just log them

**Drink:**
- Diet drink or water (not sugary)

**Optimized meal deal:** Chicken sandwich (~400 cal, 25g protein) + protein bar (~200 cal, 20g protein) + diet drink = 600 cal, 45g protein

### Stone Baked Pizza (WORST OPTION)

If you must:
- Margherita or chicken = better than pepperoni/meat feast
- Eat half, save half for later
- A whole pizza is typically 800-1000+ cal with ~30g protein

**Recommendation:** Half pizza (~450 cal, 15g protein) + supplement with protein shake later

### Office Day Strategy

| Priority | Option | Protein | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|
| 1st | Salad bar (double chicken) | 45g+ | Best macro fit |
| 2nd | Optimized meal deal | 45g | With protein bar swap |
| 3rd | Half pizza + shake later | 40g | Damage control |

## Quick Reference Card

**Protein per 100g (raw):**
| Food | Protein |
|------|---------|
| Chicken breast | 31g |
| Chicken thigh | 26g |
| Salmon | 20g |
| Tuna (tinned, drained) | 25g |
| Beef mince (lean) | 21g |
| Eggs (1 large) | 6g |
| Greek yogurt | 10g |
| Cottage cheese | 11g |

**Easy protein adds:**
- +25g protein: 1 scoop whey
- +20g protein: 200g Greek yogurt
- +12g protein: 2 eggs
- +22g protein: 100g cooked chicken

**If you're short on protein at end of day:**
- Protein shake + Greek yogurt = 45g protein, 250 cal
- Cottage cheese + handful of chicken = 38g protein, 220 cal

---

## Notes

- **Weigh your food** for the first 2 weeks. Eyeballing leads to underestimating.
- **Rice portions**: 150g cooked = roughly a fist-sized portion
- **Chicken 200g raw** = roughly a palm-sized piece, slightly larger
- **Log before you eat** - reduces the "I'll log it later" that never happens
- **Mum's cooking**: Ask her what oil/ghee she used, estimate 1-2 tbsp = 120-240 cal extra

---

## Emergency "I Have No Food" Options

When you've got nothing prepped and are about to make bad choices:

1. **Supermarket rotisserie chicken** - remove skin, 300g meat = 75g protein, ~450 cal
2. **Tinned tuna + microwave rice** - 2 tins + packet = 52g protein, ~500 cal
3. **Eggs** - scramble 5-6 = 36g protein, ~350 cal
4. **Greek yogurt tub + protein shake** - 45g protein, ~250 cal

Better than a meal deal. Log it. Move on.
