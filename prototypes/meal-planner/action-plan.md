# Action Plan: Cut from 84kg to 68-72kg

## Profile Summary

| Current | Target | Timeline |
|---------|--------|----------|
| 84kg | 68-72kg | 12 weeks initial |
| ~26% body fat | ~18-19% | 8-10kg loss goal |
| ~59kg muscle mass | Maintain/gain | Fast start → moderate pace |

**Key Context:**
- Experienced lifter, intermediate strength (Squat 80-120kg, Bench 60-90kg range)
- 3 WFH days = 3 gym days/week (skip office days initially)
- Halal diet, no budget constraint, mum can cook requests
- Leisure centre gym (may need exercise flexibility)
- Tight hips from desk work (mobility needed)
- Work: At desk 8:45, office 2 days (45min-1hr commute)

**Behavioral Profile (Critical):**
- Past unsustainability: aggressive deficit, willpower-reliant, all-or-nothing thinking, COVID crash diet lost muscle
- Tracking stops when eating off-plan (shame/avoidance pattern)
- Stress cascade: sleep breaks → diet follows → gym last
- Wake time driver: phone late → miss morning → meal deal trap (800-1000cal, low protein)
- Internal click not happened yet - readiness is "know I should"
- Most likely failure mode: "never started properly"
- What would work: habit/automaticity, needs 2-3 weeks of execution to build momentum
- Commitment: track everything always, next meal mindset for slip-ups, trust the process through plateaus

## Phase Structure (12 Weeks)

### Phase 1: Aggressive Cut (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal:** 4-5kg loss, build momentum, establish habits

**Calories:** 1,600 kcal/day (~800-900 deficit from TDEE ~2,400-2,500)
- Protein: 170g (2g/kg bodyweight) - non-negotiable
- Fat: 60g (minimum hormonal health)
- Carbs: ~120g (remainder, flexible)

### Phase 2: Moderate Cut (Weeks 5-8)
**Goal:** 2-3kg loss, sustainable pace, strength focus

**Calories:** 1,850 kcal/day (~550-600 deficit)
- Protein: 165g
- Fat: 65g
- Carbs: ~150g

### Phase 3: Final Push (Weeks 9-12)
**Goal:** 2kg loss, transition planning

**Calories:** 1,750 kcal/day (adjust based on progress)
- Reassess at week 8 based on rate of loss and adherence

## Nutrition Framework

### Daily Structure

**Morning (within 1 hour of waking):**
- Protein shake + banana = ~35g protein, ~250 cal
- Or: 4 boiled eggs + toast = ~28g protein, ~350 cal

**Lunch:**
- Protein source (chicken/fish/beef) 200g = ~40-50g protein
- Carb source (rice/potato) 150g cooked
- Vegetables unlimited
- ~500-600 cal

**Dinner:**
- Protein source 200g = ~40-50g protein
- Carb source (reduce in Phase 1)
- Vegetables
- ~500-600 cal

**Snacks (as needed to hit protein):**
- Greek yogurt (Skyr/Fage 0%) - 20g protein
- Protein bar - 20g protein
- Protein shake - 25g protein

### Meal Ideas (Halal, Quick)

**High Protein, Low Effort:**
- Air fryer chicken thighs + rice + veg
- Salmon fillet + sweet potato + greens
- Beef mince stir fry with rice
- Eggs any style + toast + avocado
- Tuna + rice + veg bowl

**Request from Mum:**
- Grilled/baked chicken (not fried in heavy oil)
- Daal with extra chicken/lamb
- Chapati with lean meat curry (ask for less oil)
- Seekh kebab (grilled)
- Any protein + rice + salad

### What to Cut

**Remove/Minimize:**
- Meal deals (800-1000 cal for low protein - this is your biggest leak)
- Crisps, ice cream, chocolate (not eliminated, but rare)
- Large portions of rice/roti with curry
- Iced coffees with sugar (switch to black or small flat white)

**Keep:**
- Diet fizzy drinks (you said these are fine for you)
- Coffee with lunch (just watch the milk)
- Your existing protein sources

## Daily Routine Design

### WFH Day (Training Day)

```
6:30 AM  - Wake (phone stays in another room overnight)
6:45 AM  - Protein shake + banana
7:00 AM  - Gym session (60-75 min)
8:15 AM  - Shower, ready
8:45 AM  - At desk for work
12:30 PM - Lunch (track in MFP)
6:00 PM  - Dinner (track in MFP)
10:00 PM - Phone down, no screens
10:30 PM - Sleep
```

### Office Day (Rest Day)

```
6:00 AM  - Wake
6:15 AM  - Protein shake + quick breakfast
6:30 AM  - Leave for commute
8:30 AM  - At office
12:30 PM - Lunch (bring food or buy carefully, TRACK IT)
6:00 PM  - Home
6:30 PM  - Walk (get steps, 20-30 min)
7:00 PM  - Dinner
10:00 PM - Phone down
10:30 PM - Sleep
```

### Key Habit: No Phone After 10pm
- This is the keystone habit
- Phone late → bad sleep → wake late → meal deal → cascade
- Physical phone location: charge in another room

---

## Cardio / Activity

**Daily Step Target:** 8,000 steps minimum, 10,000 ideal
- Not for calorie burn, for NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis)
- Walk after dinner (20-30 min)
- Take stairs, walk during calls

**Formal Cardio:** Optional but helpful
- 10-15 min post-workout incline walk (treadmill 10-12% incline, 5-6 km/h)
- Or: 10 min bike/row as cooldown

---

## Supplements

| Supplement | Dose | Timing |
|------------|------|--------|
| Whey Protein | 25-30g | Post-workout or morning |
| Creatine Monohydrate | 5g | Daily, any time |
| Vitamin D | 2000-4000 IU | With food (most people deficient) |
| Fish Oil | 1-2g EPA/DHA | With food |

---

## Tracking Protocol

### Daily
- [ ] Log all food in MyFitnessPal (even bad days - next meal mindset)
- [ ] Morning weight (after bathroom, before food)
- [ ] Steps count

### Weekly (Sunday Evening)
- [ ] Calculate weekly average weight
- [ ] Review MFP adherence (days tracked / 7)
- [ ] Note any patterns or issues

### Monthly
- [ ] Progress photos (front, side, back - same lighting, same time)
- [ ] Measurements: waist, chest, arms
- [ ] Update lift numbers (what weights are you using?)
- [ ] Export Whoop data (cycles, sleep, workouts)

### Expected Progress (Approximate)

| Week | Target Weight | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| 0 | 84.0kg | Start |
| 4 | 79-80kg | Aggressive phase ends |
| 8 | 76-77kg | Moderate phase |
| 12 | 74-75kg | End of plan |

Note: 8-10kg in 12 weeks is ambitious. 6-8kg is more realistic with muscle retention. Trust the process - weight will fluctuate day to day. Look at weekly averages.

## Start Protocol (The Launch Sequence)

You said the likely failure is "never started properly" and you need 2-3 weeks of execution to build momentum. Here's how to actually begin:

### Pre-Start (Day Before)

1. **Food Prep:**
   - Buy: eggs, chicken breast/thighs, rice, protein powder, bananas, Greek yogurt
   - Clear out: obvious junk that will tempt you
   - Prep: boil eggs for the week, portion rice

2. **Environment:**
   - Charge phone in a different room tonight
   - Set alarm for 6:30 AM
   - Lay out gym clothes
   - Pack gym bag

3. **Tracking Setup:**
   - Open MyFitnessPal, set calorie goal to 1,600
   - Set macro goals (170g protein, 60g fat, 120g carbs)

### Day 1 Protocol

**6:30 AM:** Alarm goes off. Do NOT check phone. Get up immediately.

**6:35 AM:** Drink water. Protein shake + banana.

**6:50 AM:** Leave for gym.

**7:00 AM:** Do the Push workout. Don't worry if weights are light. Just complete the session.

**8:15 AM:** Home. Shower. Log workout in MFP.

**8:45 AM:** At desk. You've already won the day.

**Throughout day:** Log all food. Hit protein. Don't stress about perfection.

**10:00 PM:** Phone goes to charging location. Not in your room.

**Day 1 success criteria:** Got to gym. Logged food. Phone away by 10. That's it.

### Week 1 Success

- [ ] 3 gym sessions completed
- [ ] 7 days of food logged (even if over calories)
- [ ] Phone in other room by 10pm (5+ nights)
- [ ] Morning weight logged daily

If you do these 4 things for week 1, you've started properly.

## When Things Go Wrong (Decision Trees)

### Missed Gym Session
- Don't try to "make it up" by doubling next session
- Just do the next scheduled session
- If you miss 2+ in a row, ask: what's the root cause? (sleep? motivation? schedule?)

### Ate Off-Plan
- LOG IT ANYWAY. This is critical. "Next meal mindset."
- One bad meal in a week of good meals = still progress
- The pattern that kills you: bad meal → don't log → more bad meals → abandon

### Weight Stalled (2+ weeks no change)
- Check: Are you actually tracking accurately? (weighing food?)
- Check: Sleep quality dropped? (Whoop recovery)
- If tracking is tight: Trust the process. Water retention is real. Give it another week.
- If still stalled at week 4+: Drop to 1,500 cal or add 15 min cardio

### Motivation Gone
- Don't wait for motivation. Go to gym anyway.
- Minimum viable workout: just do the first exercise, then leave if you want
- You won't leave. Starting is the hard part.

### Slept Terribly / Low Recovery
- Still go to gym, but reduce weight by 10-15%
- Focus on form, not load
- Get to bed early that night

---

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Phone away by 10pm** - This is the keystone. Fix this = fix sleep = fix wake time = fix food = fix gym.

2. **Track everything always** - Even bad days. Especially bad days. You stop tracking when eating off-plan - that's your pattern. Break it.

3. **Morning protein** - Don't leave the house without 30g+ protein. This prevents the meal deal trap.

4. **3 gym sessions/week minimum** - Non-negotiable. This is what preserves muscle during the cut.

5. **Next meal mindset** - One bad meal is noise. A week of bad meals is a pattern. One bad meal followed by a good meal = progress.

---

## Review Points

- **Week 4:** First major review. How's adherence? Adjust Phase 2 calories if needed.
- **Week 8:** Second review. On track for goal? Adjust Phase 3.
- **Week 12:** Full assessment. Plan next phase (continued cut, maintenance, or reverse diet).

---

## Files to Update

After implementation, update these data files:
- `data/Body-Composition.csv` - Add new INSMART readings
- Track food in MyFitnessPal (export monthly if desired)
- Whoop data continues automatically

---

## Verification

To verify the plan is working:

1. **Weekly:** Average weight trending down (0.5-0.8kg/week in Phase 1, 0.4-0.5kg in Phase 2-3)
2. **Weekly:** MFP logged 6-7 days
3. **Weekly:** 3 gym sessions completed
4. **Monthly:** Measurements showing change (waist decreasing is the key metric)
5. **Monthly:** Progress photos showing visual difference
6. **12 weeks:** Strength maintained or improved on key lifts (this confirms muscle retention)

---

## Summary

This is a 12-week plan to drop 8-10kg (realistically 6-8kg with muscle retention) through:

1. **Caloric deficit:** 1,600 → 1,850 → 1,750 cal across phases
2. **High protein:** 170g/day to preserve muscle
3. **3x/week PPL training:** On WFH days, heavy compounds, progressive overload
4. **Behavioral systems:** Phone away at 10pm, track everything, morning protein, next meal mindset
5. **Mobility work:** Built into warm-ups for hip tightness

The plan acknowledges your patterns (all-or-nothing, tracking avoidance, sleep cascade) and builds systems to counter them. The start protocol is designed to get you through the first 2-3 weeks where momentum builds.

Start date: When you're ready. But don't wait for the "internal click." It might come after you start, not before.
