    "query": "What does Khatam-un-Nabiyyin mean?",
    "answer": "In *The Seal of Prophets*, Hadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad explains **Khatam-un-Nabiyyin** (Seal of the Prophets) in a way that highlights the **finality, perfection, and universality** of Prophet Muhammad(sa)\u2019s prophethood\u2014i.e., that his message is **for all humanity and for all times**, and that he is the one who **seals** (brings to completion) the institution of prophethood in its highest sense.\n\nIn the context you provided, he illustrates this \u201cseal\u201d through the Holy Prophet(sa)\u2019s **Farewell Sermon**, delivered as a message \u201cto all mankind and for all times to come\u201d [*Seal Of Prophets*, p. 40]. He notes that the Holy Prophet(sa) addressed people as **\u201cmankind\u201d** rather than only \u201cMuslims,\u201d and declared universal human equality:\n\n> \u201c0 mankind! All of you are equal\u2026 The only preference that can be conceived is one\u2019s fear of God.\u201d [*Seal Of Prophets*, p. 40]\n\nHe then commanded that this message must continue to be conveyed globally and permanently:\n\n> \u201cWhoever is present must go on delivering the message to those who are absent and this should go on till the end of time.\u201d [*Seal Of Prophets*, p. 40\u201341]\n\nSo, from this excerpt, **Khatam-un-Nabiyyin** is tied to the idea that Prophet Muhammad(sa) is the Prophet whose guidance and mission are **universal** and **enduring**, meant to be carried \u201cto the corners of the earth\u2026 till the end of time\u201d [*Seal Of Prophets*, p. 40\u201341].\n\nIf you want the specifically Ahmadiyya doctrinal phrasing (that prophethood reaches perfection in Muhammad(sa), and any later prophet must be fully subordinate to him), that exact wording is **not explicitly stated in the pages you shared**, so I can\u2019t quote it from this provided context.",

        "text": "would turn out in disgrace the meanest of them. The message was clear and everyone knew what he meant. Umar(ra), upon hearing this, asked permission of the Holy Prophet(sa) to kill this man; he said that the insult on the The Seal of Prophets 35 person of the Holy Prophet(sa) was far too much for them to tolerate. But the Holy Prophet(sa) did not allow any retribution. It is reported that after this, Abdullah\u2019s own son also approached the Holy Prophet(sa) and said: \u201cOh Messenger of God, perhaps you thought that if you had permitted someone else to kill my father, I being his son, may harbour a private sense of revenge. However my father deserves this punishment for the insult he has hurled against you, so please permit me to slay him.\u201d The Holy Prophet(sa) smiled and said: \u201cNo, there is nothing to be done. Your father will not be punished by any one.\u201d They all returned to Medina and for many years this man lived in peace under the full protection of the Holy Founder(sa) of Islam, against whom he had blasphemed. When he died, the Holy Prophet(sa) decided to lead his funeral prayers. This was a bit too much for some of his companions. Umar(ra) reports that he blocked his passage and said: \u201cIs he not the leader of the hypocrites? Is he not the one about whom God has said that even if you ask forgiveness for him seventy times, he would not be forgiven? Then why 0 Prophet of God, who is the recipient of all these revelations, have you decided to lead his funeral prayer?\u201d The answer was: \u201cUmar, get aside; if God has informed me that he would not forgive the hypocrites even if I prayed for them seventy times, I would pray much more than that in the hope that Allah will ultimately forgive them\u201d. Such was the character of the Holy Founder(sa) of Islam. He was a man of extreme compassion, a man of principles, a man who lived a life of truth and nothing but the truth. When he found that the days of return to his Holy Master, Allah were nigh, the Holy Prophet(sa) addressed a large gathering. It was the largest gathering that he had ever spoken to. The occasion was of the last pilgrimage, also called Hajja-tul-Widaa."

    "query": "How does the Ahmadiyya community interpret the Seal of the Prophets?",
    "answer": "In the provided context, Hadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad (rh) explains that the title **\u201cSeal of Prophets\u201d** signifies **the Holy Prophet Muhammad (sa) as the highest and best of all prophets**, and that this status should inspire humility rather than boasting.\n\nHe states that in Medina, the Holy Prophet (sa) had already been told by God that he was:\n\n> \u201cthe Seal of Prophets, **which means the very best among them**\u201d [*Seal Of Prophets*, p. 20]\n\nHadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad (rh) then illustrates how the Holy Prophet (sa) himself *taught Muslims not to use this rank as a basis for insulting or triumphing over other faiths*. When a companion argued about Muhammad (sa) being superior to Jonah (as), the Holy Prophet (sa) responded:\n\n> \u201c**Do not declare my excellence over Jonah(as)**\u2026 The matter of superiority of one over the other is a question to be decided by God, not something to be exulted over.\u201d [*Seal Of Prophets*, p. 20]\n\nAnd in a similar dispute involving a Jew and a Muslim, he again said:\n\n> \u201c**Don\u2019t declare me to be better than Moses(as).**\u201d [*Seal Of Prophets*, p. 20]\n\n**So, from this excerpt, the Ahmadiyya understanding presented here is:**\n- \u201cSeal of the Prophets\u201d affirms the Holy Prophet Muhammad(sa) as **the \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e / greatest** of the prophets (\u201cthe very best among them\u201d). [*Seal Of Prophets*, p. 20]\n- This excellence is not meant to fuel religious arrogance; rather, the Holy Prophet(sa) emphasized **respectful relations** and left ultimate judgments of rank to God. [*Seal Of Prophets*, p. 20]\n\nIf you want the specifically Ahmadiyya doctrinal explanation that also addresses *how prophethood can continue in a subordinate sense without violating Khatam-un-Nabiyyin*, that detail is **not explicitly present in the provided pages**, so I would need additional context from Ahmadiyya sources (or more pages from this book) to quote it accurately.",

    "answer": "In *The Seal of Prophets*, Hazrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad explains that Prophet Muhammad(sa), despite being the \u201cSeal of Prophets,\u201d taught deep humility regarding comparisons with other prophets, and left the ultimate judgment of rank to Allah.\n\n- After a dispute where a companion claimed Muhammad(sa) was superior to Jonah(as), the Holy Prophet(sa) said: **\u201cDo not declare my excellence over Jonah(as), son of Muta\u2026 The matter of superiority of one over the other is a question to be decided by God, not something to be exulted over.\u201d** [*Seal of Prophets*, p. 20]\n\n- In another incident involving a Jew and a Muslim arguing about Muhammad(sa) and Moses(as), the Holy Prophet(sa) similarly rebuked the Muslim and said: **\u201cDon\u2019t declare me to be better than Moses.\u201d** He then **\u201crelate[d] the excellence of Moses(as) and paid tribute to him\u201d** to comfort the Jew [*Seal of Prophets*, pp. 20\u201321].\n\nSo, the relationship presented here is that Prophet Muhammad(sa) is the Seal of Prophets (the highest and final law-bearing Prophet), yet he maintained respect for earlier prophets and forbade boastful superiority-claims\u2014teaching that any question of relative rank is for Allah to decide, not for followers to weaponize in arguments [*Seal of Prophets*, p. 20].\n\nThis provided context does not explicitly discuss *later* prophets after Muhammad(sa) (i.e., prophets appearing in his Ummah), so I can\u2019t quote from these pages about that aspect. If you share the relevant excerpt (or if you want, I can explain the Ahmadiyya view generally without quotes), I can address it directly.",

Prophet Muhammad(sa) was a humble man in every relationship 16 The Seal of Prophets with people and was humble, of course, to God. He was humble even to those who had accepted him to be the Prophet of God. Once in Medina, after he had already been told by God that he was the Seal of Prophets, which means the very best among them, one of his companions developed an argument with someone who held in very high respect an earlier prophet by the name of Jonah(as). The companion of the Holy Founder(sa) of Islam said that Muhammad(sa) was superior, whereas the other said that Jonah(as) was far better. When this was reported to the Holy Prophet(sa), he said: \u201cDo not declare my excellence over Jonah(as), son of Muta, because it is against the dignity of human relationship to go on boasting about your leaders against the leaders of others. The matter of superiority of one over the other is a question to be decided by God, not something to be exulted over.\u201d That was the message given to us, unfortunately forgotten by many Muslims of today. A similar incident happened between a Jew and a Muslim over the question of superiority between Muhammad(sa) and Moses(as). The Muslim became extremely annoyed with the haughty attitude of the Jew and even slapped him. This Jew went to the Holy Prophet(sa) and complained. The companion responsible for this was very strongly rebuked by the Holy Prophet(sa), who then used the same expression as used in the last incident: \u201cDon\u2019t declare me to be. better than Moses.\u201d He went on to relate the excellence of Moses(as) and paid tribute to him by way of comforting the distress caused to the Jew\u2019s heart.

They had never seen him committing a sin and believed him to be the most innocent man on earth. They asked him: \u201cSinless as you are, why, O Prophet of God, you seek forgiveness from Allah?\u201d He replied: \u201cShould I not be grateful to my God for all the favours bestowed upon me?\u201d At another occasion when the same question about forgiveness and man\u2019s piety was being discussed, the Holy Prophet(sa) told his companions that no human on earth would be forgiven because of good deeds. It is only Allah\u2019s Grace, which ultimately delivers humans from the bondage of sin and grants them admission into heaven. This made them wonder and one of them asked: \u201c0 Prophet of God, will you not be forgiven for your piety and good deeds?\u201d He said: \u201cNo, not even me. I will be forgiven only by the Grace of God. Everything belongs to Him, nothing is ours. Whatever He has granted us, we use it and employ it to the best of our knowledge and abilities. Even a man with acts of piety, having spent all his life doing good deeds, will not be forgiven because of his actions. Those noble opportunities were given to him by God.\u201d His humility knew no bounds. When sitting among his followers, ordinarily clothed, eating the same food as they did, he did not occupy a very special place. Many a time, people were mistaken as to who was the Holy Founder(sa) of Islam. Abu Bakr(ra), who later became the First Caliph of Islam, was older than he and perhaps had a longer beard, I don\u2019t know, but something in him led some strangers to address him as the Prophet of God.

In this regard I have chosen a few facets of his real life and will share them with you, for you to judge how close to humans yet how vastly different he was. Why I said that being Abd was more important is because I believe that the prophecies of a Prophet are always being disputed by the enemy. At one end the Prophet is close to His God and at the other he is close to humanity. The humans cannot directly judge the authenticity of his claim of being from God, but they most certainly can judge him as a human. If as a man he is true, it is impossible for him to be a false prophet. Again I quote Bosworth Smith, who in turn quotes Sir William Muir, in the following words: \u201cMohammed was of middle height and of a strongly built frame; his head was large, and across his ample forehead, and above finely arching eyebrows, ran a strongly marked vein, which, when he was angry, would turn black and throb visibly. His eyes were coal black and piercing in their brightness; his hair curled slightly; and a long beard, which, like other Orientals, he would stroke when in deep thought, added to the general impressiveness of his appearance. His step was quick and firm \u2018like that of one descending a hill\u2019.\u201d (Page 83) Bosworth Smith in the 1874 edition of his book Mohammed and Mohammedanism, writes about his character in the following words:"

Then I read the opening chapter of the Holy Qur\u2019an and a verse from a chapter called Al-Kahf. Kalima Shahada, which I recited, was the more elaborate version of the one generally known. It is in two parts; first, Allah is one, there is no God but Allah; and the other, Muhammad is His servant, a man and a Prophet. The emphasis is on man before you move on to consider him as a prophet. It was the shorter version of the Kalima, \u0650 \u0644\u064e \u0627\u0650\u0644\u0670 \u0627\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e \u0627\u06c1\u0644\u0644\u064f \u0645\u064f \u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0640\u062f\u064c \u0631\u0651\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0640\u0640\u0648\u0652\u0644\u064f \u0627\u06c1\u0644\u0644 that was before Gibbon, a famous orientalist and historian, when he opined on it.

However, we do see a change in the wind, which has brought about one of the outstanding writers on Islam from England, that is Thom(as) Carlyle. He ushered in a new era of an approach towards Islam. In an age darkened by hatred he was the first lark with the courage and nobility to sing the praises of Prophet Muhammad(sa), and was the first swallow to give an indication of the coming spring. After Carlyle, things began to change but did not go on to develop into a steady trend. Instead it remained an interrupted phenomena. We see that all through the history of criticism of the Prophet Muhammad(sa) there were scholars who sank back to their past, with a Salman Rushdie being born here and there. The birth of Rushdie is not a new phenomenon in the history of religious bigotry; deeply related to ignorance, the lack of tolerance is something well-known to man.

        "text": "Hounslow, Honourable Members of Parliament and other distinguished guests. We consider this function a very holy occasion because of the subject to be discussed here. I am deeply honoured and overjoyed to speak to you about something I love so much. The Seal of Prophets 3 Chapter 1 Kalima Shahada, and Western View of Muhammad(sa) To begin with, I recited before you the Kalima Shahada. Then I read the opening chapter of the Holy Qur\u2019an and a verse from a chapter called Al-Kahf. Kalima Shahada, which I recited, was the more elaborate version of the one generally known. It is in two parts; first, Allah is one, there is no God but Allah; and the other, Muhammad is His servant, a man and a Prophet. The emphasis is on man before you move on to consider him as a prophet. It was the shorter version of the Kalima, \u0650 \u0644\u064e \u0627\u0650\u0644\u0670 \u0627\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e \u0627\u06c1\u0644\u0644\u064f \u0645\u064f \u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0640\u062f\u064c \u0631\u0651\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0640\u0640\u0648\u0652\u0644\u064f \u0627\u06c1\u0644\u0644 that was before Gibbon, a famous orientalist and historian, when he opined on it. Bosworth Smith writes about it in Mohammed and Mohammedanism (Lecture II, R. Bosworth Smith; Smith, Elder & Co., 15 Waterloo Place, London, (1874) as follows: \u201dIt is almost equally strange that Gibbon, who has done such full justice to Mohammed in the general result, should say at starting, \u2018Mohammed\u2019s religion consists of an eternal truth, and a necessary fiction - There is one God, and Mohammed is his prophet\u2019.\u201d (Page 82) \u2018\u2018"

The address was delivered at Heathland School in Hounslow. Many distinguished guests including the Mayor of Hounslow and some Members of Parliament attended it. In 1992, this address was published in the form of a booklet. By the Grace of Allah, it has now been revised and this edition is reprinted with some amendments and additions. Please note that the name Muhammad and his titles - the Holy Prophet, the Founder of Islam - is generally followed by the symbolsa for the salutation \u201cSal-Lallaho \u2018Alaihi wa Sallam\u201d meaning \u2018May peace and blessings of Allah be upon him\u2019. The names of most other prophets and messengers of God are followed by the symbolas for \u201cAlaiyhis-Salam\u201d meaning \u2018on whom be peace\u2019. The actual salutations have not been set out in full, in most cases, for the sake of brevity. Muslim readers should treat the full salutation as implicit. In the revision of this text, the following people had the honour of assisting Hadhrat Khalifatul Masih IV: Chaudhary Khurshid Ahmad Sial, Munir-ud-Din Shams, Farina Qureshi and Farida Ahmad. May Allah bless them all. May Allah make this booklet a source of enlightenment and guidance for all - Ameen. The Publisher"

Hast thou not been loving to thy kinsfolk, kind to thy neighbours, charitable to the poor, faithful to thy word, and ever a defender of the truth?\u201d(Page 78) The Seal of Prophets 15 In contrast to the attitude of Khadijah(ra) the opinion of all his friends was suddenly transformed after he declared himself to be a Messenger from God. Those who used to call him Al-Amin, the most trustworthy, who went to him for resolving their disputes and who trusted him entirely, started blaming him as guilty of extreme falsehood. Bosworth Smith records this contradictory attitude of the Meccans, after Prophet Muhammad\u2019ssa pronouncement of being commissioned from God, in the following words: \u201cPeople pointed the finger of scorn at him as he passed by: \u2018There goeth the son of Abdallah, who hath his converse with the heavens!\u2019 They called him a driveller, a star\u00ad gazer, a maniac- poet. His uncles sneered, and the main body of the citizens treated him with that contemptuous indifference, which must have been harder to him to bear than active persecution.\u201d (Page 79) Then he tells us that Meccans tried persuasion and treaties, bribes and threats against Prophet Muhammad(sa) \u201cShould they array against me and put the sun on my right hand, and the moon on my left,\u201d said Mohammed, \u201cyet while God should command me, I would not renounce my purpose.\u201d (Page 80) \u201cThese are not the words, nor this the course of an impostor\u201d, writes Bosworth Smith. Prophet Muhammad(sa) was a humble man in every relationship"

Though many civilised nations would deny its undercurrents, my experience suggests that it is found in every people and in every part of the world. It is not just a question of white feeling a kind of superiority over the black, but also the black nurture a feeling of vindictive superiority over the white. It remains the most dangerous undercurrent of human thought and motivation. Under the explicit instructions of the Holy Prophet(sa), I deliver to you this message of racial equality. All of us being the creation of God, belonging to the same ancestry, how can we permit ourselves to sink to the level where issues of human superiority over others take grip of us. When the time of his departure from this life was near, the Holy Prophet(sa) was given a choice by God to either return to Him or spend some more years in this earthly existence. His answer was: \u201cFir-Rafiqil-A\u2019ala: I prefer to return to my Exalted Lord.\u201d These were the last words he uttered before passing on to eternal life. This is the man called Muhammad(sa). His reality has been long distorted by the unreal legends built by his adversaries. It is high time that the West and the whole world following it, stop believing blindfolded in the legends and return to the reality. The reality of Muhammad(sa) is far from being hate worthy. His reality is only to be loved and is always to be loved till the end of mankind."

It is only Allah\u2019s Grace, which ultimately delivers humans from the bondage of sin and grants them admission into heaven. This made them wonder and one of them asked: \u201c0 Prophet of God, will you not be forgiven for your piety and good deeds?\u201d He said: \u201cNo, not even me.

But the Holy Prophet(sa) did not allow any retribution. It is reported that after this, Abdullah\u2019s own son also approached the Holy Prophet(sa) and said: \u201cOh Messenger of God, perhaps you thought that if you had permitted someone else to kill my father, I being his son, may harbour a private sense of revenge. However my father deserves this punishment for the insult he has hurled against you, so please permit me to slay him.\u201d The Holy Prophet(sa) smiled and said: \u201cNo, there is nothing to be done. Your father will not be punished by any one.\u201d They all returned to Medina and for many years this man lived in peace under the full protection of the Holy Founder(sa) of Islam, against whom he had blasphemed. When he died, the Holy Prophet(sa) decided to lead his funeral prayers. This was a bit too much for some of his companions. Umar(ra) reports that he blocked his passage and said: \u201cIs he not the leader of the hypocrites? Is he not the one about whom God has said that even if you ask forgiveness for him seventy times, he would not be forgiven? Then why 0 Prophet of God, who is the recipient of all these revelations, have you decided to lead his funeral prayer?\u201d The answer was: \u201cUmar, get aside; if God has informed me that he would not forgive the hypocrites even if I prayed for them seventy times, I would pray much more than that in the hope that Allah will ultimately forgive them\u201d. Such was the character of the Holy Founder(sa) of Islam. He was a man of extreme compassion, a man of principles, a man who lived a life of truth and nothing but the truth. When he found that the days of return to his Holy Master, Allah were nigh, the Holy Prophet(sa) addressed a large gathering. It was the largest gathering that he had ever spoken to. The occasion was of the last pilgrimage, also called Hajja-tul-Widaa."

On the contrary, from many narrations on this subject we can believe that he suffered the most. He was a dauntless, fearless person who never refrained from approaching danger head on. In his lifetime, he fought many defensive battles without ever waging a single offensive war. He was usually found in the most dangerous areas of the battle, where the fighting would rage like mad.

But the Holy Prophet(sa) did not allow any retribution. It is reported that after this, Abdullah\u2019s own son also approached the Holy Prophet(sa) and said: \u201cOh Messenger of God, perhaps you thought that if you had permitted someone else to kill my father, I being his son, may harbour a private sense of revenge. However my father deserves this punishment for the insult he has hurled against you, so please permit me to slay him.\u201d The Holy Prophet(sa) smiled and said: \u201cNo, there is nothing to be done. Your father will not be punished by any one.\u201d They all returned to Medina and for many years this man lived in peace under the full protection of the Holy Founder(sa) of Islam, against whom he had blasphemed. When he died, the Holy Prophet(sa) decided to lead his funeral prayers. This was a bit too much for some of his companions. Umar(ra) reports that he blocked his passage and said: \u201cIs he not the leader of the hypocrites? Is he not the one about whom God has said that even if you ask forgiveness for him seventy times, he would not be forgiven? Then why 0 Prophet of God, who is the recipient of all these revelations, have you decided to lead his funeral prayer?\u201d The answer was: \u201cUmar, get aside; if God has informed me that he would not forgive the hypocrites even if I prayed for them seventy times, I would pray much more than that in the hope that Allah will ultimately forgive them\u201d. Such was the character of the Holy Founder(sa) of Islam. He was a man of extreme compassion, a man of principles, a man who lived a life of truth and nothing but the truth. When he found that the days of return to his Holy Master, Allah were nigh, the Holy Prophet(sa) addressed a large gathering. It was the largest gathering that he had ever spoken to. The occasion was of the last pilgrimage, also called Hajja-tul-Widaa."

Wherever I visit in the world, this question pursues me. I am asked about Khomeini\u2019s edict of death against Salman Rushdie. I tell them the Islam I learned from the Holy Prophet(sa), speaks of no punishment whatsoever against blasphemy. No question of death or anything else for that matter. Among other things, I quote this particular incident in the life of the Holy Prophet(sa), also briefly recorded in the Holy Qur\u2019an. Before the Holy Prophet\u2019ssa arrival in Medina, there was a prominent leader who by the consensus of Medinite, was rising to be their joint leader. His name was Abdullah Bin Obey Bin Salul. After the Prophet\u2019ssa arrival things gradually changed and instead of Abdullah, the Holy Prophet(sa) was accepted by the common consensus of people as their new leader. This made Abdullah Bin Obey Bin Salul extremely jealous. He went on giving voice to his injured feelings in one way or another. His behaviour was such that the other Muslims referred to him as the chief monaafiq, meaning the chief of hypocrites. Once, when returning from an expedition which was overall a failure, and all participants were extremely tired and disappointed, this man Abdullah, thought it a fit time to take his revenge. In the presence of a few people, he declared that upon returning to Medina, the noblest among them would turn out in disgrace the meanest of them. The message was clear and everyone knew what he meant. Umar(ra), upon hearing this, asked permission of the Holy Prophet(sa) to kill this man; he said that the insult on the"

That was the man, Prophet Muhammad, may peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, who always shared miseries with his devoted servants. There was no difference whatsoever. On the contrary, from many narrations on this subject we can believe that he suffered the most. He was a dauntless, fearless person who never refrained from approaching danger head on. In his lifetime, he fought many defensive battles without ever waging a single offensive war. He was usually found in the most dangerous areas of the battle, where the fighting would rage like mad. A narrator reports that when the Holy Prophet(sa) was sought during a battle, they would look for him in that area where combat was at its fiercest and he would always be in the midst. Once in Medina, during the dead of the night, people heard some disturbing noises. In those days attack was feared from all sides, so they saddled their horses and went on to investigate. They found the Holy Prophet(sa) already returning from that place riding an unsaddled horse. He had gone singly, in haste, without even preparing his ride. He assured them that it was nothing serious and they could all return to their homes. Once during a journey on a very hot summer\u2019s day, he was resting under the shade of a tree.

I am deeply honoured and overjoyed to speak to you about something I love so much. The Seal of Prophets 3 Chapter 1 Kalima Shahada, and Western View of Muhammad(sa) To begin with, I recited before you the Kalima Shahada. Then I read the opening chapter of the Holy Qur\u2019an and a verse from a chapter called Al-Kahf. Kalima Shahada, which I recited, was the more elaborate version of the one generally known. It is in two parts; first, Allah is one, there is no God but Allah; and the other, Muhammad is His servant, a man and a Prophet. The emphasis is on man before you move on to consider him as a prophet. It was the shorter version of the Kalima, \u0650 \u0644\u064e \u0627\u0650\u0644\u0670 \u0627\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e \u0627\u06c1\u0644\u0644\u064f \u0645\u064f \u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0640\u062f\u064c \u0631\u0651\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0640\u0640\u0648\u0652\u0644\u064f \u0627\u06c1\u0644\u0644 that was before Gibbon, a famous orientalist and historian, when he opined on it. Bosworth Smith writes about it in Mohammed and Mohammedanism (Lecture II, R. Bosworth Smith; Smith, Elder & Co., 15 Waterloo Place, London, (1874) as follows: \u201dIt is almost equally strange that Gibbon, who has done such full justice to Mohammed in the general result, should say at starting, \u2018Mohammed\u2019s religion consists of an eternal truth, and a necessary fiction - There is one God, and Mohammed is his prophet\u2019.\u201d (Page 82) \u2018\u2018"

Once on a journey, he heard cries of a small bird in distress. He turned to his companions and asked what had happened to the bird. One of them said that he had taken two eggs from her nest. The Holy Prophet(sa) said: \u201cReturn them immediately.\u201d In another narration of the same incident it is said that two chicks and not eggs had been taken, and the Holy Prophet(sa) said to his companions that no mother should ever be pained on account of her offspring.

He climbed down and drank his fill Upon corning out, he observed a dog panting with thirst, perhaps about to die. He went back in and filled his shoes with water, then holding them in his teeth, returned to the surface and quenched the thirst of the dog. The Holy Founder(sa) said: \u201cGod has told me that this man was pardoned for all his previous sins.\u201d In another narration it is said that it was a prostitute who did this. Her whole life was full of sins, but she was pardoned in the sight of God for an act of kindness to an animal. One of his companions asked if they would be rewarded for acts of mercy to animals. He said: \u201cYes, all those animals who have wet livers.\u201d The word \u2018wet\u2019 in Arabic is used to indicate softness and sensibility. I have translated it literally but the"

The Holy Prophet(sa) of Islam turned to him and said: \u201cYes, go ahead, perform the Umrah and please do not forget me in your prayers.\u201d Such was the humility of the man, on whose prayers every Muslim depended that he was asking one of his own servants to remember him in his prayers. All through his life he shared in every type of hardship faced by the Muslims in general. During the Battle of the Ditch he is known to have suffered hunger along with the others. When portions were allotted in digging the ditch, he was no exception and did his part of labour. Once a companion saw him in a state that overwhelmed him. He remarked: \u201cOn the day of the Battle of Al-Ahzaab, I saw the Holy Prophet(sa) carrying earth which was covering the whiteness of his abdomen\u201d. He was saying: \u201cWithout you, 0 Lord, we would have no guidance, nor have given any charity, nor prayed; so please bless us with tranquillity and make firm our feet when we meet our enemy. Indeed, people have oppressed us but never shall we yield if they try to bring affliction upon us because of you.\u201d Jaabir narrates that they were digging in the days of Al-Ahzaab and came across a big rock. They told the Holy Prophet(sa) about it. When he got up, they saw a stone tied to his belly; he had not eaten anything for three days. It was an Arab custom to tie a stone like this when extremely oppressed with hunger, perhaps this helped to alleviate its pangs. In another narration of the same incident, we find that companions of the Holy Prophet(sa) had a stone each tied to their bellies, but when the Holy Prophet(sa) lifted his shirt to show them, they saw two stones tied to his belly indicating that he was suffering from hunger more than them.

They can only arise **as followers within his Ummah**, reflecting his spiritual perfection\u2014hence preserving his status as **Khatam-un-Nabiyyin (Seal of the Prophets)**.\n\nHowever, **the specific excerpts you provided from *The Seal of Prophets* do not directly address the doctrinal question** of whether prophets can come after Muhammad(saw) in this subordinate sense. The provided pages focus on the Holy Prophet\u2019s(sa) universal message, equality, humility, and compassion (e.g., his address to \u201cmankind\u201d and the instruction to spread the message \u201ctill the end of time\u201d) [*Seal of Prophets*, p. 40\u201341], but they do not explicitly discuss post-Muhammad prophethood.\n\nIf you share the relevant passage(s) from Hazrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad\u2019s book where he explains **Khatam-un-Nabiyyin** and the possibility of non-law-bearing prophethood, I can answer with **direct quotations and page citations** in the format you requested.",

Though many civilised nations would deny its undercurrents, my experience suggests that it is found in every people and in every part of the world. It is not just a question of white feeling a kind of superiority over the black, but also the black nurture a feeling of vindictive superiority over the white. It remains the most dangerous undercurrent of human thought and motivation. Under the explicit instructions of the Holy Prophet(sa), I deliver to you this message of racial equality. All of us being the creation of God, belonging to the same ancestry, how can we permit ourselves to sink to the level where issues of human superiority over others take grip of us. When the time of his departure from this life was near, the Holy Prophet(sa) was given a choice by God to either return to Him or spend some more years in this earthly existence. His answer was: \u201cFir-Rafiqil-A\u2019ala: I prefer to return to my Exalted Lord.\u201d These were the last words he uttered before passing on to eternal life. This is the man called Muhammad(sa). His reality has been long distorted by the unreal legends built by his adversaries. It is high time that the West and the whole world following it, stop believing blindfolded in the legends and return to the reality. The reality of Muhammad(sa) is far from being hate worthy. His reality is only to be loved and is always to be loved till the end of mankind."

His companions named him \u2018Al Amin, The Faithful\u2019. A man of truth and fidelity; true in what he did, in what he spake and thought. They noted that he always meant something. A man rather taciturn in speech; silent when there was nothing to be said; but pertinent, wise, sincere, when he did speak; always throwing light on the matter. This is the only sort of speech worth speaking! Through life we find him to have been regarded as an altogether solid, brotherly, genuine man. A serious, sincere character; yet amiable, cordial, companionable, jocose even; - a good laugh in him withal: there are men whose laugh is as untrue as anything about them; who cannot laugh. One hears of Mahomet\u2019s beauty: his fine sagacious honest face, brown florid complexion, beaming black eyes; - I somehow like too that vein on the brow, which swelled-up black when he was in anger\u201d. (Pages 287-288) Prophet Muhammad(sa) had lived among his people for forty years before he was commissioned by God as a Prophet. Even the severest critics of his character cannot put a finger on any blemish in his life up to that age. There is no dissension or disagreement among historians regarding this fact. As such the Holy Qur\u2019an challenged those who rejected him by saying: \ufd3e\u06f1\u06f7\ufd3f \u064e\u0641\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062f\u06e1 \u0644\u064e\u0628\u0650\u062b\u06e1\u062a\u064f \u0641\u0650\u06cc\u06e1\u06a9\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0639\u064f\u0645\u064f \u064b\u0627 \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646\u06e1 \u0642\u064e\u0628\u06e1\u0644\u0650 \u0656 \u0615 \u0627\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e \u062a\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0642\u0650\u0644\u064f \u06e1\u0646"

He was humble even to those who had accepted him to be the Prophet of God. Once in Medina, after he had already been told by God that he was the Seal of Prophets, which means the very best among them, one of his companions developed an argument with someone who held in very high respect an earlier prophet by the name of Jonah(as). The companion of the Holy Founder(sa) of Islam said that Muhammad(sa) was superior, whereas the other said that Jonah(as) was far better. When this was reported to the Holy Prophet(sa), he said: \u201cDo not declare my excellence over Jonah(as), son of Muta, because it is against the dignity of human relationship to go on boasting about your leaders against the leaders of others. The matter of superiority of one over the other is a question to be decided by God, not something to be exulted over.\u201d That was the message given to us, unfortunately forgotten by many Muslims of today. A similar incident happened between a Jew and a Muslim over the question of superiority between Muhammad(sa) and Moses(as). The Muslim became extremely annoyed with the haughty attitude of the Jew and even slapped him. This Jew went to the Holy Prophet(sa) and complained. The companion responsible for this was very strongly rebuked by the Holy Prophet(sa), who then used the same expression as used in the last incident: \u201cDon\u2019t declare me to be. better than Moses.\u201d He went on to relate the excellence of Moses(as) and paid tribute to him by way of comforting the distress caused to the Jew\u2019s heart.

His step was quick and firm \u2018like that of one descending a hill\u2019.\u201d (Page 83) Bosworth Smith in the 1874 edition of his book Mohammed and Mohammedanism, writes about his character in the following words:"

The Holy Founder of Islam, may peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, had built an image in 26 The Seal of Prophets the society of being a man of absolute justice. Even when there were feuds between Muslims and Jews, or Muslims and idolaters, they would seek his judgement. In one case it is reported that a piece of land was disputed between a Muslim and a Jew. They approached the Holy Prophet(sa) and asked him to decide the matter. The Holy Prophet(sa) first asked the Muslim claimant to provide proof. The Muslim said that he had no witnesses but was telling the truth on his word of honour. The Holy Prophet(sa) ignored him and asked the respondent to swear in the name of God if the land belonged to him. The Muslim protested and said: \u201c0 Prophet of God, he will swear falsely. It is trivial for him to be untruthful for a piece of land\u201d. The Holy Prophet(sa) replied: \u201cThere is no other way to decide this matter, if he swears then the land would be his\u201d. And that is exactly what happened. Once a small trade party visited Khaiber, an area occupied by a Jewish clan by the name of Bani-Nazeer. These people were earlier expelled from Medina and were rehabilitated there; but that is a different story. This place had become a Jewish stronghold from then on. When the trade party from among the Muslims visited Khaiber, one of them was murdered. They returned to the Holy Prophet(sa) and asked that the responsibility for the murder should be placed on Jews of that area, and blood money imposed on them as a group. The Holy Prophet(sa) said: \u201cDo you have any proof of this man being murdered by a Jew?\u201d They replied: \u201cThere is no witness but it has to be one of them, nobody else lives there.\u201d The Holy Prophet(sa) said: \u201cThe only available course is that the Jews must swear their innocence.\u201d The Jews did that and were acquitted of the murder. However, by the order of the Holy Prophet(sa), the aggrieved were paid blood money from the state treasury. We see in him kindness"

He was humble even to those who had accepted him to be the Prophet of God. Once in Medina, after he had already been told by God that he was the Seal of Prophets, which means the very best among them, one of his companions developed an argument with someone who held in very high respect an earlier prophet by the name of Jonah(as). The companion of the Holy Founder(sa) of Islam said that Muhammad(sa) was superior, whereas the other said that Jonah(as) was far better. When this was reported to the Holy Prophet(sa), he said: \u201cDo not declare my excellence over Jonah(as), son of Muta, because it is against the dignity of human relationship to go on boasting about your leaders against the leaders of others. The matter of superiority of one over the other is a question to be decided by God, not something to be exulted over.\u201d That was the message given to us, unfortunately forgotten by many Muslims of today. A similar incident happened between a Jew and a Muslim over the question of superiority between Muhammad(sa) and Moses(as). The Muslim became extremely annoyed with the haughty attitude of the Jew and even slapped him. This Jew went to the Holy Prophet(sa) and complained. The companion responsible for this was very strongly rebuked by the Holy Prophet(sa), who then used the same expression as used in the last incident: \u201cDon\u2019t declare me to be. better than Moses.\u201d He went on to relate the excellence of Moses(as) and paid tribute to him by way of comforting the distress caused to the Jew\u2019s heart.

However, the principle, that even in killing you should show mercy, was enunciated by the Holy Founder(sa) of Islam himself. 34 The Seal of Prophets Chapter 7 The Controversy over Blasphemy Now I turn to the most hotly debated question of today, that of blasphemy. Wherever I visit in the world, this question pursues me. I am asked about Khomeini\u2019s edict of death against Salman Rushdie. I tell them the Islam I learned from the Holy Prophet(sa), speaks of no punishment whatsoever against blasphemy. No question of death or anything else for that matter. Among other things, I quote this particular incident in the life of the Holy Prophet(sa), also briefly recorded in the Holy Qur\u2019an. Before the Holy Prophet\u2019ssa arrival in Medina, there was a prominent leader who by the consensus of Medinite, was rising to be their joint leader. His name was Abdullah Bin Obey Bin Salul. After the Prophet\u2019ssa arrival things gradually changed and instead of Abdullah, the Holy Prophet(sa) was accepted by the common consensus of people as their new leader. This made Abdullah Bin Obey Bin Salul extremely jealous. He went on giving voice to his injured feelings in one way or another. His behaviour was such that the other Muslims referred to him as the chief monaafiq, meaning the chief of hypocrites. Once, when returning from an expedition which was overall a failure, and all participants were extremely tired and disappointed, this man Abdullah, thought it a fit time to take his revenge. In the presence of a few people, he declared that upon returning to Medina, the noblest among them would turn out in disgrace the meanest of them. The message was clear and everyone knew what he meant. Umar(ra), upon hearing this, asked permission of the Holy Prophet(sa) to kill this man; he said that the insult on the"

While engaged in a dialogue in the Holy Prophet\u2019ssa mosque, the time for their prayers arrived. They asked permission from the Holy Prophet(sa) to go out to offer their prayers. The Holy Prophet, may peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said that the mosque was also a place of worship and they were welcome to pray there, and they did. In the meantime, some companions reached the mosque and saw the Christians worshipping facing the opposite direction from the Qiblah in that Mosque. They moved forward to object to this, but he firmly prohibited them from interfering and said: \u201cI have permitted them because this is the house of God, and no man has the right to object to anyone who worships God in a place devoted for the sake of worship\u201d. On another occasion, a delegation from the monastery of St Catherine begged him to write a pronouncement to the effect that their monastery should be protected when Islam would become victorious in that part of the world. The Holy Prophet(sa) immediately accepted the request and wrote orders to that effect. To my knowledge, the parchment on which this order was written is still preserved in Turkey. It reads: \u2018No one should ever interfere with the property of the Monastery, nor with the figure of the cross or any other article which represents their faith. They should not be molested in any manner whatsoever. Anyone ignoring this will not be one of us\u2019.

Then I read the opening chapter of the Holy Qur\u2019an and a verse from a chapter called Al-Kahf. Kalima Shahada, which I recited, was the more elaborate version of the one generally known. It is in two parts; first, Allah is one, there is no God but Allah; and the other, Muhammad is His servant, a man and a Prophet. The emphasis is on man before you move on to consider him as a prophet.

Once on a journey, he heard cries of a small bird in distress. He turned to his companions and asked what had happened to the bird. One of them said that he had taken two eggs from her nest. The Holy Prophet(sa) said: \u201cReturn them immediately.\u201d In another narration of the same incident it is said that two chicks and not eggs had been taken, and the Holy Prophet(sa) said to his companions that no mother should ever be pained on account of her offspring. The Holy Prophet(sa) once narrated an incident to his companions: \u201cA man who was thirsty in a desert discovered a well full of water. He climbed down and drank his fill Upon corning out, he observed a dog panting with thirst, perhaps about to die. He went back in and filled his shoes with water, then holding them in his teeth, returned to the surface and quenched the thirst of the dog. The Holy Founder(sa) said: \u201cGod has told me that this man was pardoned for all his previous sins.\u201d In another narration it is said that it was a prostitute who did this. Her whole life was full of sins, but she was pardoned in the sight of God for an act of kindness to an animal. One of his companions asked if they would be rewarded for acts of mercy to animals. He said: \u201cYes, all those animals who have wet livers.\u201d The word \u2018wet\u2019 in Arabic is used to indicate softness and sensibility. I have translated it literally but the"
